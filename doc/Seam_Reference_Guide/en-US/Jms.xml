    <title>Asynchronicity and messaging</title>
    <para>
        Seam makes it very easy to perform work asynchronously from a web request. When most people
        think of asynchronicity in Java EE, they think of using JMS. This is certainly one way to
        approach the problem in Seam, and is the right way when you have strict and well-defined
        quality of service requirements. Seam makes it easy to send and receive JMS messages using
        Seam components.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        But for cases when you are simply want to use a worker thread, JMS is overkill. Seam layers a simple
        asynchronous method and event facility over your choice of <emphasis>dispatchers</emphasis>:

    <title>Messaging in Seam</title>
    
    <para>
        Seam makes it easy to send and receive JMS messages to and from
        Seam components. Both the message publisher and the message receiver
        can be Seam components.
    </para>

    <para>
        You'll first learn to setup a queue and topic message publisher and then 
        look at an example that illustrates how to perform the message exchange.

        <title>Configuration</title>
        <para>
            To configure Seam's infrastructure for sending JMS messages,
            you need to tell Seam about any topics and queues you want to
            send messages to, and also tell Seam where to find the
            <literal>QueueConnectionFactory</literal> and/or
            <literal>TopicConnectionFactory</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Seam defaults to using <literal>UIL2ConnectionFactory</literal>
            which is the usual connection factory for use with JBossMQ. If
            you are using some other JMS provider, you need to set one or
            both of <literal>queueConnection.queueConnectionFactoryJndiName</literal>
            and <literal>topicConnection.topicConnectionFactoryJndiName</literal>
            in <literal>seam.properties</literal>, <literal>web.xml</literal>
            or <literal>components.xml</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            You also need to list topics and queues in <literal>components.xml</literal>
            to install Seam managed <literal>TopicPublisher</literal>s and
            <literal>QueueSender</literal>s:

        <title>Receiving messages using a message-driven bean</title>
        <para>
            You can process messages using any EJB 3 message-driven bean. The MDB
            can even be a Seam component, in which case it's possible to inject
            other event- and application- scoped Seam components. Here's an example
            of the payment receiver, which delegates to a payment processor.
        </para>    
        <note>
            <para>
                You'll likely need to set the create attribute on the <literal>@In</literal> annotation to true (i.e.
                create = true) to have Seam create an instance of the component being injected. This isn't necessary if
                the component supports auto-creation (e.g., it's annotated with <literal>@Autocreate</literal>).
            </para>

        <para>
            First, create an MDB to receive the message.

        <title>Asynchronicity</title>

        <para>
            Asynchronous events and method calls have the same quality of service expectations as  
            the underlying dispatcher mechanism. The default dispatcher, based upon a 
            <literal>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</literal> performs efficiently but provides no
            support for persistent asynchronous tasks, and hence no guarantee that a task
            will ever actually be executed. If you're working in an environment that supports
            EJB 3.0, and add the following line to <literal>components.xml</literal>:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<async:timer-service-dispatcher/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            then your asynchronous tasks will be processed by the container's EJB timer service. If 
            you're not familiar with the Timer service, don't worry, you don't need to interact with 
            it directly if you want to use asynchronous methods in Seam. The important thing to know
            is that any good EJB 3.0 implementation will have the option of using persistent timers, 
            which gives some guarantee that the tasks will eventually be processed.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Another alternative is to use the open source Quartz library to manage asynchronous method. 
            You need to bundle the Quartz library JAR (found in the <literal>lib</literal> directory) 
            in your EAR and declare it as a Java module in <literal>application.xml</literal>.
            The Quartz dispatcher may be configured by adding a Quartz property file to the classpath. 
           	It must be named <literal>seam.quartz.properties</literal>.  In addition, 
            you need to add the following line to <literal>components.xml</literal> to install the 
            Quartz dispatcher. 
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<async:quartz-dispatcher/>]]></programlisting>
            
        <para>
            The Seam API for the default <literal>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</literal>, the EJB3 
            <literal>Timer</literal>, and the Quartz <literal>Scheduler</literal> are largely the 
            same. They can just "plug and play" by adding a line to <literal>components.xml</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <sect2>
        <title>Asynchronous methods</title>
        
        <para>
            In simplest form, an asynchronous call just lets a method call be processed asynchronously 
            (in a different thread) from the caller. We usually use an asynchronous call when we want 
            to return an immediate response to the client, and let some expensive work be processed in
            the background. This pattern works very well in applications which use AJAX, where the
            client can automatically poll the server for the result of the work.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            For EJB components, we annotate the local interface to specify that a method is processed
            asynchronously.
        </para>

        <para>

            <para>
                Component-driven events may also be asynchronous. To raise an event for asynchronous
                processing, simply call the <literal>raiseAsynchronousEvent()</literal> method of 
                the <literal>Events</literal> class. To schedule a timed event, call the
                <literal>raiseTimedEvent()</literal> method, passing a <emphasis>schedule</emphasis>
                object (for the default dispatcher or timer service dispatcher, use <literal>TimerSchedule</literal>). 
                Components may observe asynchronous events in the usual way, but remember that only the 
                business process context is propagated to the asynchronous thread.

            <title>Handling exceptions from asynchronous calls</title>
            
            <para>
                Each asynchronous dispatcher behaves differently when an
                exception propagates through it. For example, the 
                <literal>java.util.concurrent</literal> dispatcher will suspend
                further executions of a call which repeats, and the EJB3 timer
                service will swallow the exception. Seam therefore catches any
                exception which propagates out of the asynchronous call before
                it reaches the dispatcher.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                By default, any exception which propagates out from an 
                asynchronous execution will be caught and logged at error level.
                You can customize this behavior globally by overriding the
                <literal>org.jboss.seam.async.asynchronousExceptionHandler</literal>
                component: 
            </para>
            
            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Scope(ScopeType.STATELESS)
@Name("org.jboss.seam.async.asynchronousExceptionHandler")
public class MyAsynchronousExceptionHandler extends AsynchronousExceptionHandler { 

   @Logger Log log;
   
   @In Future timer;
   
   @Override
   public void handleException(Exception exception) {
      log.debug(exception);
      timer.cancel(false);
   }
   
}]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                Here, for example, using <literal>java.util.concurrent</literal>
                dispatcher, we inject its control object and cancel all future
                invocations when an exception is encountered
            </para>
            
            <para>
                You can also alter this behavior for an individual component by
                implementing the method 
                <literal>public void handleAsynchronousException(Exception exception);</literal>
                on the component. For example: 
            </para>
            
            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[   public void handleAsynchronousException(Exception exception) {
      log.fatal(exception);
