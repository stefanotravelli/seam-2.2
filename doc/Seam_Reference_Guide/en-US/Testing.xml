	<para>
	    Most Seam applications will need at least two kinds of automated tests:
	    <emphasis>unit tests</emphasis>, which test a particular Seam component
	    in isolation, and scripted <emphasis>integration tests</emphasis> which
	    exercise all Java layers of the application (that is, everything except the
	    view pages).
	</para>
	<para>
	   Both kinds of tests are very easy to write.

		<title>Unit testing Seam components</title>
		<para>
		    All Seam components are POJOs. This is a great place to start if you
		    want easy unit testing. And since Seam emphasises the use of bijection 
            for inter-component interactions and access to contextual objects, it's 
            very easy to test a Seam component outside of its normal runtime 
            environment.
		</para>
		<para>
		    Consider the following Seam Component which creates a statement of
            account for a customer:
		</para>
		
        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Stateless
@Scope(EVENT)
@Name("statementOfAccount")
public class StatementOfAccount {
   
   @In(create=true) EntityManager entityManager
   
   private double statementTotal;
   
   @In
   private Customer customer;
   
   @Create
   public void create() {
      List<Invoice> invoices = entityManager
         .createQuery("select invoice from Invoice invoice where invoice.customer = :customer")
         .setParameter("customer", customer)
         .getResultList();
      statementTotal = calculateTotal(invoices);
   }
   
   public double calculateTotal(List<Invoice> invoices) {
      double total = 0.0;
      for (Invoice invoice: invoices)
      {
         double += invoice.getTotal();
      }
      return total;
   }
   
   // getter and setter for statementTotal
   
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            We could write a unit test for the calculateTotal method (which tests
            the business logic of the component) as follows:
        </para>

        <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class StatementOfAccountTest {
    
    @Test
    public testCalculateTotal {
       List<Invoice> invoices = generateTestInvoices(); // A test data generator
       double statementTotal = new StatementOfAccount().calculateTotal(invoices);
       assert statementTotal = 123.45;
    }   
}
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            You'll notice we aren't testing retrieving data from or persisting
            data to the database; nor are we testing any functionality 
            provided by Seam. We are just testing the logic of our POJOs. Seam
            components don't usually depend directly upon container infrastructure,
            so most unit testing are as easy as that!
       </para>
       <para>    
            However, if you want to test the entire application, read on.
       </para>
        
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Integration testing Seam components</title>
        
        <para>
            Integration testing is slightly more difficult. In this case, we can't eliminate
            the container infrastructure; indeed, that is part of what is being tested! At
            the same time, we don't want to be forced to deploy our application to an
            application server to run the automated tests. We need to be able to reproduce
            just enough of the container infrastructure inside our testing environment to be 
            able to exercise the whole application, without hurting performance too much.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The approach taken by Seam is to let you write tests that exercise your
            components while running inside a pruned down container environment (Seam,
            together with the JBoss Embedded container; see 
            <xref linkend="config.install.embedded" /> for configuration details)
        </para>
        
<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class RegisterTest extends SeamTest

            <title>Using mocks in integration tests</title>
            
            <para>
                Occasionally, we need to be able to replace the implementation of some
                Seam component that depends upon resources which are not available in 
                the integration test environment. For example, suppose we have some
                Seam component which is a facade to some payment processing system:
            </para>
            
            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Name("paymentProcessor")
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public boolean processPayment(Payment payment) { .... }
}]]></programlisting>
            
            <para>
                For integration tests, we can mock out this component as follows:
            </para>
            
            <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Name("paymentProcessor")
@Install(precedence=MOCK)
public class MockPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
    public boolean processPayment(Payment payment) {
        return true;
    }
}]]></programlisting>
            
            <para>
                Since the <literal>MOCK</literal> precedence is higher than the default
                precedence of application components, Seam will install the mock 
                implementation whenever it is in the classpath. When deployed into 
                production, the mock implementation is absent, so the real component
                will be installed.
            </para>
            
        </section>
        
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Integration testing Seam application user interactions</title>
        
        <para>
            An even harder problem is emulating user interactions. A third problem is where 
            to put our assertions. Some test frameworks let us test the whole application
            by reproducing user interactions with the web browser. These frameworks have
            their place, but they are not appropriate for use at development time.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            <literal>SeamTest</literal> lets you write <emphasis>scripted</emphasis> tests,
            in a simulated JSF environment. The role of a scripted test is to reproduce 
            the interaction between the view and the Seam components. In other words, you 
            get to pretend you are the JSF implementation!
        </para>
        
        <para>
            This approach tests everything except the view.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Let's consider a JSP view for the component we unit tested above:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting role="XHTML"><![CDATA[<html>
 <head>
  <title>Register New User</title>

  <f:view>

         <td>Username</td>

        <para>
            We want to test the registration functionality of our application (the stuff
            that happens when the user clicks the Register button). We'll reproduce the JSF 
            request lifecycle in an automated TestNG test:

        <para>
            Notice that we've extended <literal>SeamTest</literal>, which provides a 
            Seam environment for our components, and written our test script as an 
            anonymous class that extends <literal>SeamTest.FacesRequest</literal>, 
            which provides an emulated JSF request lifecycle. (There is also a
            <literal>SeamTest.NonFacesRequest</literal> for testing GET requests.)
            We've written our code in methods which are named for the various JSF 
            phases, to emulate the calls that JSF would make to our components. Then 
            we've thrown in various assertions.

            You'll find plenty of integration tests for the Seam example applications
            which demonstrate more complex cases. There are instructions for running
            these tests using Ant, or using the TestNG plugin for eclipse:

              It's very important you don't put the compile time JBoss AS 
              dependencies from <literal>lib/</literal> (e.g. 
              <literal>jboss-system.jar</literal>) on the classpath, these
              will cause Embedded JBoss to not boot. So, just add the 
              dependencies (e.g. Drools, jBPM)you need as you go.

              You also need to include the <literal>bootstrap/</literal> 
              directory on the classpath; <literal>bootstrap/</literal> contains
              the configuration for Embedded JBoss.

              And, of course you need to put your built project and tests onto
              the classpath as well as jar for your test framework. Don't forget
              to put all the correct configuration files for JPA and Seam onto 
              the classpath as well.Seam asks Embedded JBoss to deploy any 
              resource (jar or directory) which has 
              <literal>seam.properties</literal> in it's root. Therefore, if you
              don't assemble a directory structure that resembles a deployable 
              archive containing your built project, you must put a 
              <literal>seam.properties</literal> in each resource.

            If you need to insert or clean data in your database before each 
            test you can use Seam's integration with DBUnit.  To do this, extend 
            <literal>DBUnitSeamTest</literal> rather than SeamTest.

         <caution>
            DBUnit supports two formats for dataset files, flat and XML.  Seam's
            <literal>DBUnitSeamTest</literal> assumes the flat format is used, so make sure that 
            your dataset is in this format.

           You need to tell DBUnit about the datasource you are using by

            It also allows you to insert binary data into the test data set (n.b.

            We create a new <literal>FacesRequest</literal> as normal.  Inside

            <literal>getRenderedMailMessage(viewId);</literal>, passing the 
            viewId of the message to render.  The method returns the rendered
            message on which you can do your tests. You can of course also use
            any of the standard JSF lifecycle methods.

          <para>
            There is no support for rendering standard JSF components so you
