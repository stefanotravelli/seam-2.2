   <title>Seam on BEA's Weblogic</title>
   
   <para> Weblogic 10.3 is BEA's latest stable JEE5 server offering.  Seam 
      applications can be deployed and developed on Weblogic servers, and
      this chapter will show you how. There are some known issues with the 
      Weblogic servers that will need to be worked around, and configuration 
      changes that are needed specific to Weblogic. </para>
   
   <para> First step is to get Weblogic downloaded, installed and running. Then 
      we'll talk about Seam's JEE5 example and the hurdles to
      getting it running. After that, the JPA example will
      be deployed to the server. Then finally we will create a
      <literal>seam-gen</literal> application and get it up and running to
      provide a jump start to your own application. </para>

      <title>Installation and operation of Weblogic</title>
      <para> First things first we need to get the server installed.  There are 
         some outstanding issues that were not addressed in 10.3, but it does 
         solve some of the issues discussed below without the need for BEA 
         patches.  The previous release 10.0.MP1 is also available, but 
         requires some BEA patches to function correctly. </para>

            <para> 10.0.MP1 has some known issues with EJBs that use

            <para> This is the latest stable release of the Weblogic server, 
              and the one that will be used with the examples below.  This 
              version has addressed some of the issues with EJBs that were in 
              10.0.MP1.  However one of the changes did not make it into this 
              release.  See <xref linkend="weblogic-ejb-issues" /> for the 
              details, but because of this we still need to use the special 
              Weblogic seam jar discussed below.

         exposes the second EJB issue.  We will be using this jar for the 
         <literal>jee5/booking</literal> example, as it avoids the known BEA 
         issues.

         Do you want to run Seam using EJB's on Weblogic? If so there

         <title>EJB3 Issues with Weblogic</title>
         
         <para>
            For several releases of Weblogic there has been an issue
            with how Weblogic generates stubs and compiles EJB's that use 
            variable arguments in their methods. This is confirmed in the 
            Weblogic 9.X and 10.0.MP1 versions.  Unfortunately the 10.3 version 
            only partially addresses the issue as detailed below.
         </para>
         
         <section>
           <title>The <literal>varargs</literal> Issue</title>
           <para>
            The basic explanation of the issue is that the Weblogic EJB
            compiler mistakes methods that use <literal>varargs</literal>
            as having the <literal>transient</literal> modifier.  When
            BEA generates its own stub class from those classes during 
            deployment it fails and the deployment does not succeed.  Seam uses 
            variable arguments in one of its internal EJB's (
            <literal>TimerServiceDispatcher</literal>).  If you see exceptions 
            like below during deployment you are running an unpatched version 
            of 10.0.MP1.

              It appears that when Weblogic 10.3 was released the neglected to 
              include this fix!!  This means that Weblogic 10.0.MP1 with patches
              will function correctly, but 10.3 will still require the special 
              Seam jar described below.  Not all users have seen this and there 
              may be certain combinations of OS/JRE that do not see this, 
              however is has been seen many times.  Hopefully Oracle/BEA will 
              release an updated patch for this issue on 10.3.  When they do we 
              will update this reference guide as needed.

               So that Seam's users can deploy an EJB application to
               Weblogic a special Weblogic specific jar has been
               created, starting with Seam 2.0.2.CR2. It is located in
               the
               <literal>$SEAM/lib/interop</literal>
               directory and is called
               <literal>jboss-seam-wls-compatible.jar</literal>
               . The only difference between this jar and the
               <literal>jboss-seam.jar</literal>
               is that it does not contain the
               <literal>TimerServiceDispatcher</literal>
               EJB. To use this jar simply rename the
               <literal>jboss-seam-wls-compatible.jar</literal>
               to
               <literal>jboss-seam.jar</literal>
               and replace the original in your applications
               <literal>EAR</literal>
               file. The
               <literal>jee5/booking</literal>
               example demonstrates this.  Obviously with this jar you will not
               be able to use the <literal>TimerServiceDispatcher</literal> 
               functionality.

                              These changes do two two different things.
                              The first element
                              <literal>library-ref</literal>
                              tells weblogic that this application will
                              be using the deployed JSF libraries. The
                              second element
                              <literal>

                              tells weblogic that the

                              jars take precedence. This avoids a
                              conflict with hibernate.

                              The changes described here work around an
                              issue where Weblogic is only using a
                              single instance of the
                              <literal>sessionBeanInterceptor</literal>
                              for all session beans. Seam's interceptor
                              caches and stores some component specific
                              attributes, so when a call comes in - the
                              interceptor is primed for a different
                              component and an error is seen. To solve
                              this problem you must define a separate
                              interceptor binding for each EJB you wish
                              to use. When you do this Weblogic will use
                              a separate instance for each EJB.

            <para>
               The Weblogic 10.X version of the example will use the in
               memory hsql database instead of the built in PointBase
               database. If you wish to use the PointBase database you
               must setup a PointBase datasource, and adjust the
               hibernate setting in
               <literal>persistence.xml</literal>
               to use the PointBase dialect. For reference the
               <literal>jpa/weblogic92</literal>
               example uses PointBase.

                           pre-installed datasource. The 10.x version uses
                           the <literal>hsql</literal> database and a

      <title> Deploying an application created using
         <literal>seam-gen</literal> on Weblogic 10.x</title>
      
      <para><literal>seam-gen</literal> is a very useful tool for developers
         to quickly get an application up and running, and provides a foundation
         to add your own functionality. Out of box <literal>seam-gen</literal>
         will produce applications configured to run on JBoss AS. These
         instructions will show the steps needed to get it to run on Weblogic.
         </para>
      <para><literal>seam-gen</literal> was build for simplicity so, as you
         can imagine, deploying an application generated by
         <literal>seam-gen</literal> to Weblogic 10.x is not too hard.
         Basically it consists of updating or removing some configuration
         files, and adding dependent jars that Weblogic 10.x does not ship
         with.</para>
      
      <para>This example will cover the basic <literal>seam-gen WAR</literal>
         deployment. This will demonstrate Seam POJO components, Hibernate
         JPA, Facelets, Drools security, RichFaces, and a configurable
         dataSource.</para>

         <para>The first thing we need to do it tell
            <literal>seam-gen</literal> about the project we want to make.
            This is done by running <literal>./seam setup</literal> in the base
            directory of the Seam distribution. Note the paths here are my own,
            feel free to change for you environment.
