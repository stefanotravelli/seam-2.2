"Most web application architectures have no first class construct to "

"reduce this redundant traffic, Java applications often introduce a data "
"(second-level) cache that keeps commonly accessed data between requests. "
"This cache is necessarily inefficient, because invalidation is based upon an "
"LRU policy instead of being based upon when the user has finished working "

"HTTP Session can grow quite large, making the HTTP session difficult to "
"cluster. Developing mechanisms to isolate session state associated with "
"different concurrent conversations, and incorporating failsafes to ensure "
