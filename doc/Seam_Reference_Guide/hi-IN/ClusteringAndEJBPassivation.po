"Since day one, Seam has always provided support for stateful applications "
"running in a cluster. Up to this point, you have learned that Seam provides "
"state management in the form of additional scopes and by governing the life "
"cycle of stateful (scoped) components. But state management in Seam goes "
"beyond creating, storing and destroying instances. Seam tracks changes to "
"JavaBean components and stores the changes at strategic points during the "
"request so that the changes can be restored when the request shifts to a "
"secondary node in the cluster. Fortunately, monitoring and replication of "
"stateful EJB components is already handled by the EJB server, so this "
"feature of Seam is intended to put stateful JavaBeans on par with their EJB "
"cohorts."

"The important point of this section is that the MEI is there for a reason. "
"It's there to ensure that the extended persistence context can retain intact "
