"JBoss jBPM is a business process management engine for any Java SE or EE "
"environment. jBPM lets you represent a business process or user interaction "
"as a graph of nodes representing wait states, decisions, tasks, web pages, "
"etc. The graph is defined using a simple, very readable, XML dialect called "
"jPDL, and may be edited and visualised graphically using an eclipse plugin. "
"jPDL is an extensible language, and is suitable for a range of problems, "
"from defining web application page flow, to traditional workflow management, "
"all the way up to orchestration of services in a SOA environment."
