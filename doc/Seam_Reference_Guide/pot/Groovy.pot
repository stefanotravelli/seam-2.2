"One aspect of JBoss Seam is its RAD (Rapid Application Development) "
"capability. While not synonymous with RAD, one interesting tool in this "
"space is dynamic languages. Until recently, choosing a dynamic language was "
"required choosing a completely different development platform (a development "
"platform with a set of APIs and a runtime so great that you would no longer "
"want to use you old legacy Java [sic] APIs anymore, which would be lucky "
"because you would be forced to use those proprietary APIs anyway). Dynamic "
"languages built on top of the Java Virtual Machine, and <ulink url=\"http://"
"groovy.codehaus.org\">Groovy</ulink> in particular broke this approach in "
"silos."

"JBoss Seam now unites the dynamic language world with the Java EE world by "
"seamlessly integrating both static and dynamic languages. JBoss Seam lets "
"the application developer use the best tool for the task, without context "
"switching. Writing dynamic Seam components is exactly like writing regular "
"Seam components. You use the same annotations, the same APIs, the same "
"everything."
