"Seam grew out of the frustration of the Hibernate team with the "
"statelessness typical of the previous generation of Java application "
"architectures. The state management architecture of Seam was originally "
"designed to solve problems relating to persistence &#8212; in particular "
"problems associated with <emphasis>optimistic transaction processing</"
"emphasis>. Scalable online applications always use optimistic transactions. "
"An atomic (database/JTA) level transaction should not span a user "
"interaction unless the application is designed to support only a very small "
"number of concurrent clients. But almost all interesting work involves first "
"displaying data to a user, and then, slightly later, updating the same data. "
"So Hibernate was designed to support the idea of a persistence context which "
"spanned an optimistic transaction."

"Unfortunately, the so-called \"stateless\" architectures that preceded Seam "
"and EJB 3.0 had no construct for representing an optimistic transaction. So, "
"instead, these architectures provided persistence contexts scoped to the "
"atomic transaction. Of course, this resulted in many problems for users, and "
"is the cause of the number one user complaint about Hibernate: the dreaded "
"<literal>LazyInitializationException</literal>. What we need is a construct "
"for representing an optimistic transaction in the application tier."

"EJB 3.0 recognizes this problem, and introduces the idea of a stateful "
"component (a stateful session bean) with an <emphasis>extended persistence "

"however there are two problems:"

"Seam solves the first problem by providing conversations, and stateful "
"session bean components scoped to the conversation. (Most conversations "
"actually represent optimistic transactions in the data layer.) This is "
"sufficient for many simple applications (such as the Seam booking demo) "
"where persistence context propagation is not needed. For more complex "
"applications, with many loosly-interacting components in each conversation, "
"propagation of the persistence context across components becomes an "
"important issue. So Seam extends the persistence context management model of "
"EJB 3.0, to provide conversation-scoped extended persistence contexts."

"EJB session beans feature declarative transaction management. The EJB "
