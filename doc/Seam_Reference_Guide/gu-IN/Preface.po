"<emphasis>conversation context</emphasis>, which is preserved across "

"Unlike plain Java EE or J2EE components, Seam components may "
"<emphasis>simultaneously</emphasis> access state associated with the web "
"request and state held in transactional resources (without the need to "
"propagate web request state manually via method parameters). You might "
"object that the application layering imposed upon you by the old J2EE "
"platform was a Good Thing. Well, nothing stops you creating an equivalent "
"layered architecture using Seam &#8212; the difference is that "
"<emphasis>you</emphasis> get to architect your own application and decide "
"what the layers are and how they work together."

"JSF and EJB 3.0 are two of the best new features of Java EE 5. EJB3 is a "
"brand new component model for server side business and persistence logic. "
"Meanwhile, JSF is a great component model for the presentation tier. "
"Unfortunately, neither component model is able to solve all problems in "
"computing by itself. Indeed, JSF and EJB3 work best used together. But the "
"Java EE 5 specification provides no standard way to integrate the two "
"component models. Fortunately, the creators of both models foresaw this "

"It is possible to write Seam applications where \"everything\" is an EJB. "
"This may come as a surprise if you're used to thinking of EJBs as coarse-"
"grained, so-called \"heavyweight\" objects. However, version 3.0 has "
"completely changed the nature of EJB from the point of view of the "

"an annotated JavaBean. Seam even encourages you to use session beans as JSF "

"We're all used to the concept of declarative transaction management and "

"declarative persistence context management. These are three examples of a "
"broader problem of managing state that is associated with a particular "
"<emphasis>context</emphasis>, while ensuring that all needed cleanup occurs "
"when the context ends. Seam takes the concept of declarative state "
"management much further and applies it to <emphasis>application state</"
"emphasis>. Traditionally, J2EE applications implement state management "
"manually, by getting and setting servlet session and request attributes. "
"This approach to state management is the source of many bugs and memory "
"leaks when applications fail to clean up session attributes, or when session "
"data associated with different workflows collides in a multi-window "
"application. Seam has the potential to almost entirely eliminate this class "

"components is supported (such as in JSF), it is virtually useless for "

"EJB 3.0 embraces annotations and \"configuration by exception\" as the "

"Unfortunately, JSF is still heavily dependent on verbose XML configuration "
"files. Seam extends the annotations provided by EJB 3.0 with a set of "
"annotations for declarative state management and declarative context "

"Seam components, being plain Java classes, are by nature unit testable. But "

"as a core feature of the framework. You can easily write JUnit or TestNG "
"tests that reproduce a whole interaction with a user, exercising all "
"components of the system apart from the view (the JSP or Facelets page). You "
