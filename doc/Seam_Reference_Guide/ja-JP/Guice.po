"Google Guice is a library that provides lightweight dependency injection "
"through type-safe resolution. The Guice integration (part of the Seam IoC "
"module) allows use of Guice injection for all Seam components annotated with "
"the <literal>@Guice</literal> annotation. In addition to the regular "
"bijection that Seam performs (which becomes optional), Seam also delegates "
"to known Guice injectors to satisfy the dependencies of the component. Guice "
"may be useful to tie non-Seam parts of large or legacy applications together "
"with Seam."

"The goal is to create a hybrid Seam-Guice component. The rule for how to do "

"importing the type <literal>org.jboss.seam.ioc.guice.Guice</literal>)."
