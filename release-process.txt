Seam Release Process
====================

Notify branch is closed
------------------------
* Send an email to seam-dev@lists.jboss.org.
  - State a version of the following :
    - As all issues in JIRA for Seam <release> are now resolved, the release 
      process for <release> is now underway.  Please don't make any commits to 
      the <branch or trunk> without checking with and getting approval from 
      this mail list first. 

Updating version numbers
------------------------
* Update the version information:
  - readme.txt 
    - one place at top including date.
  - changelog.txt
    - Generate a JIRA release note report for the release in "text" format
        - Only "issue types" that have jira's will work
        - Usually that is (Bug, Feature Request, Task, and Patch)
        - Check all the issue types one at a time to determine final list.
  - build/default.build.properties 
    - Change the version numbers as needed
    - Set the qualifier using a "." ex. ".CR1" or ".GA"
    - Check that build.properties has the qualifier commented out
    
Maven repository settings
-------------------------
* A released version of seam should not reference any repositories other than
  "repository.jboss.org".  See "build/readme.txt" for details.
  - Search "$SEAM/build" for "repositories".  
    - Comment out any repository entry not "http://repository.jboss.org/maven2"
    - Should only be entries in "root.pom.xml" and "docs.pom.xml"
  - Search "$SEAM/build" for "artifact:remoteRepository"
    - Note any that reference other repositories
    - <TODO: determine acceptable list (ci, embedded, etc...)/>
  - Verify prior to tagging
    - Clean our your local maven repository
        - ex. "~/.m2"
        - <TODO document way to set local repo settings for clean build />
    - run "ant cleanall testall testreport" with these changes
    - This should build, and test without a problem.
  - Run "ant dependencyReport"
    - Review for snapshot dependencies

SVN tagging and checkout
------------------------
<NOTE testing can begin prior to official tagging but a complete process 
        should be executed on the tag prior to release/> 
* Tag the release (XX as needed)
    -"svn copy https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/XX/XX 
               https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_x_x_x_XXX 
               -m "create JBoss_Seam_x_x_x_XXX tag""
        - ex. "svn copy https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/trunk 
               https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_2_1_0_B1 
               -m "create JBoss_Seam_2_1_0_B1 tag""
* In a clean directory checkout the newly tagged seam source ( XX as needed)
    - "svn co https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_x_x_x_XXX seam"  
        - ex. "svn co https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_2_1_0_B1 seam"
* In the original branch/trunk change:
    - Qualifier back to "-SNAPSHOT" in default.build.properties file.
        - The version numbers should be incremented as appropriate.
        - Any new work is that versions snapshot
    - Revert any Maven repository changes if needed

JDK Version Specific Information
--------------------------------
The latest version of Sun's JDK 1.5 is used for building the release, and the 
majority of the testing.  The JDK 1.6 section below outlines the JDK 1.6 
building and testing process used during the release process.  

Building and Checking Dist
--------------------------
* Run "mkdir ../releaselogs" for release artifacts and logs.
    
* Create the distribution build
    - run "ant cleanall dist > ../releaselogs/x.x.x.XX.distbuild.txt"
    - Use the dist build for all example tests
    
* Diff the zip, gz, and exploded version of the dist build
    - example of how to do it:
        - explode the zip and gz into "../tmp/zip" and "../tmp/gz"
        - cp distribution directory into "../tmp/dist" 
        - in "../tmp" run:
            - "diff -r ./gz/. ./zip/."
            - "diff -r ./gz/. ./dist/."
    - There should be no differences.
    - Compare the new dist to dist of the previous version using the same method
        - Manually look over for any glaring differences or errors.
    - Delete "../tmp" if you wish
    
* check that the following files/directories exist in the dist "ls -1"
    bootstrap
    build
    build.properties
    build.xml
    changelog.txt
    dependency-report.txt
    doc
    examples
    extras
    lgpl.txt
    lib
    readme.txt
    seam
    seam-gen
    seam-text.g
    seam.bat
    seam2migration.txt
    seam21migration.txt
    src
    ui

* check that the following source directories exist in the dist "ls -1 src"
    debug
    excel
    gen
    interop
    ioc
    mail
    main
    pdf
    remoting
    resteasy
    rss
    test
    wicket

* Archive reports
    - run these in the dist directory
        find . -name *.jar > ../releaselogs/jarlist.txt 
        find . -name *.sar > ../releaselogs/sarlist.txt
        find . -name *.war > ../releaselogs/warlist.txt
        find . -name *.ear > ../releaselogs/earlist.txt
        find . -name *.zip > ../releaselogs/ziplist.txt
        find . -name *.gz > ../releaselogs/gzlist.txt
        find . -name *seam*.jar > ../releaselogs/seamjarlist.txt
    - Manually review the lists for problems
        - <TODO: list expected items or provide listing in svn/>        
 
* Built source verification, dependency report & test suite
    - Clean our your local maven repository
        - ex. "rm -Rf ~/.m2"
        - <TODO document way to set local repo settings for clean build/>        
    - Create a copy of the $DIST directory
        - rename the copy with "*.orig"
        - the idea is the leave the original pristine for example testing.
        
    ** Source verification **
        - run "ant > ../releaselogs/x.x.x.XX.sourcebuild.txt"
        - diff the original and the built versions of the $DIST directories
            - only difference should be build related 
            - <TODO: list expected differences/>
        - Extract seam jars from orig, and the newly built into tmp directories
            - diff the directories
            - Should be no differences except version of ant and/or jdk versions
        
    ** Dependency report **
        - "ant dependencyReport > ../releaselogs/x.x.x.XX.dependencybuild.txt"
        - run "cp ./dependency-report.txt ../releaselogs"
        - Review for snapshot dependencies
            - there should be none.
        - Compare with real jar versions from META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
            - <TODO: A tool is needed to do this effectively/>
        
    ** Testsuite execution **
        - "ant cleanall validateall testall testreport 
                   > ../releaselogs/x.x.x.XX.testallreport.txt"
        - check report/junit-noframes.html
            - There should be no failures or errors.
        - run "cp -R test-output ../releaselogs"
        - run "cp -R test-report ../releaselogs"
        
    ** Compare the original distribtion to the one used for the testing.
        - Review changes in thirdparty jars, directories, and files.
            - <TODO: generate list of acceptable difference>             
    
    - Delete or rename to original dist.
    - Rename the "*.orig" back to the original name
 
Example verification
--------------------
* The list of examples below is extensive, and testing may not touch each.
    - This should be based on risk analysis, and release note review.
    - For a major/minor GA build they should all be tested.
    - Any examples that are not tested should be noted. 
* Verify the the following are accurate and up to date:
    - "$DIST/readme.txt" 
    - "$DIST/examples/readme.txt"    
* For these examples verify the following:
    - readme.txt is accurate

JBDS and seam-gen verification
------------------------------
These tests use a stable version of MySQL and the latest release of JBDS.  Be sure
to use the latest stable release of tools (2.1.1.GA at the time of writing), and
to also apply the JBoss tools provided WTP patch.  <TODO: update is version changes
behavior>

* export the following tables to MySQL:
CREATE TABLE `Person` (
  `username` varchar(10) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `birthdate` date default NULL,
  `address` varchar(600) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`username`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE `Vehicle` (
  `ownerUsername` varchar(10) default NULL,
  `make` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `model` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `year` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `registration` varchar(8) NOT NULL,
  `state` varchar(2) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY USING BTREE (`registration`,`state`),
  KEY `ownerUsername` (`ownerUsername`),
  CONSTRAINT `owner` FOREIGN KEY (`ownerUsername`) REFERENCES `Person` (`username`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

<NOTE: seam-gen should be able to run without an internet connection.  To test 
       this you should first remove/rename your maven repository (document 
       option to set this as a property).  Then either disable networking, or 
       lock down a firewall on the test machine so that no requests are allowed 
       out.  Then test the various seam-gen targets. JBoss-as may not start in 
       the configuration so testing the live app may need to be done after
       executing the various seam-gen targets.  This does not have to be
       done for each test below but the different targets should be verified./>       

* Review seam-gen chapter of the reference guide
  - accurate and up to date
* seam-gen EAR 
  - run seam  with setup create-project and explode
      - during setup choose an EAR project

  - run "seam new-action new-form restart"
      - test both generated pages 
  - run seam test 
  - run "ant validate" in seam-gen project directory
* seam-gen IceFaces EAR test

      - during setup choose to use icefaces
      - during setup choose an EAR project    
      - verify basic functionality
   - run seam generate-entities restart    
      - test the basic functionality of the app (CRUD on each table)
   - run seam test
   - run "ant validate" in seam-gen project directory
* seam-gen WAR 
  - run seam with setup create-project and explode
      - during setup choose a WAR project
      - verify basic functionality
  - run seam generate-entities restart
      - test the basic functionality of the app (CRUD on each table)
  - run "seam new-action new-form restart"
      - test both generated pages
  - run seam test

Portal Bridge Verification
--------------------------
* Use the latest released version of the PortalBridge (PBR) and JBoss Portal.
  - http://labs.jboss.com/portletbridge
  - http://www.jboss.org/jbossportal/
* <NOTE: because the bridge is beta first test the example using the PBR
         distribution.  Then follow the steps below to upgrade the seam 
         version in the example.  Then retest the example./>
* Deploy PBR seam booking example following the PBR document instructions.
    - Review any known issues with the PBR in the PBR Jira project.
* Verify the example and functionality.
    - User authentication through portal
        - use default users, and new users that are created
    - Basic hotel booking
        - user both text search and search button 
        - change dates, and options in the booking
        - confirm, logout, login, verify confirmation, cancel confirmation
            - <NOTE: can not confirm booking ATM>
    - Conversation handling
        - launch several hotels booking conv. from the search page
        - individually confirm and switch between conversations.
        - <NOTE: Can not lauch into multiple conversations ATM>
    - <NOTE: logging in/out through the portlet, registering new users, and 
             changing passwords do not work, and jiras have been entered
             for them to be removed as it is integrated with portal auth/>
* Upgrade the seam version in the seam portlet booking example
    - download the src distribution of the PBR
    - edit the $PBR_SRC/examples/seam/booking/pom.xml file
        - adjust the seam version properties at the top of the file
    - build the example by running "mvn install" in the $PBR_SRC/examples dir
    - <NOTE: You need to remove the "javassist.jar" from both the EAR
             and WAR lib directories.  This is related to PBR-2 - but for some
             reason the javassist.jar is still placed in both./>
* Deploy a second version of the booking example as a separate portlet
    - <TODO: DEFER - this is not supported in the bridge yet/>
    - <TODO: there may be a new chatroom seam portlet for this testing/>
    
JDK 1.6 Specific Testing
-------------------------
The latest available version of Sun's JDK 1.6 will be used for tests and steps
in this section.

<NOTE: 2.1.0.B1 will be the first execution of this process - it needs to be
       reviewed, and modified as needed/>

* Building and comparing the JDK1.6 built distribution
    - checkout a clean version of the tag in a new/clean directory.
    - run "ant cleanall dist > ../releaselogs/x.x.x.XX.jdk16distbuild.txt"
    - use this dist for all testing in this section
    - diff the JDK 1.5 version of the dist to the JDK 1.6
        - <TODO create a listing of expected changes/>
    
* Source build validation
    - Follow the steps above for Source Verification
        - except put "jdk16" in the log file redirects    

* Testsuite execution
    - Follow the steps above for Testsuite Execution
        - except put "jdk16" in the log file and artifact names
            
* Example execution
    - There will not be a complete testing of the examples on 1.6
        - The list below should be modified as needed based on risk

    ** JBoss 4.2.3 examples **
      - booking
      - dvdstore
      - excel
      - nestedbooking
      - remoting/chatroom

      - jee5
      - jpa  

* seam-gen 
    - Follow the steps above for seam-gen testing
        - EAR app
        - WAR app
  
Document review
---------------
* Review the API javadocs in both IE and FF.
    - Specifically for version differences
    - This is not a full review at all
* Review the Reference Guide documentation in both IE and FF.
    - Review for format and code styles
    - Review for version numbers, and dependencies
    - Review any extensive changes based on release notes and the team. 
    - This is not a full review at all.

Final Build + Upload
--------------
* When ready for the release
    - checkout a clean version of the tag in a new/clean directory.
    - run "ant cleanall dist -Dbuild.translations=true > ../releaselogs/x.x.x.XX.finaldistbuild.txt"
    - diff this to the one used for testing

* Follow instructions for sourceforge upload
    - Create md5 files for the ".zip" and ".tar.gz" files
        - <QUESTION: do we want to create md5 files for the archives/>
        - <NOTE: not for 2.0.X/>
    - upload the .zip and .tar.gz and md5 files
        - FTP to your SF users "/incoming" directory
    
* Login to sourceforge.org and go to jboss.org project
    - Under admin tab click on "file releases"
    - Add a release to the "JBoss Seam" project
    - Set "Status" to "hidden"
    - Paste this release changelog snippet in the "changelog"
    - Paste this release readme.txt in the "release notes" 
    - Add the files uploaded to the release
    - Keep everything hidden for now.

* Upload the "$DIST/doc" directory to "docs.jboss.com/seam/<NEW VERSION>" 
    - Note: this can take a long time.
    
* Maven release procedure.(see build/readme.txt for details)
    - Checkout/update JBoss repository 
        - checkout "svn co https://svn.jboss.org/repos/repository.jboss.org/maven2"
            - Note this can take a very long time
        - update (if already local) "svn update ." in the "maven2" directory.
    - Adding this to an eclipse project with svn plugin can make it much easier.
    - Set the "offline.repository.jboss.org" property in "build/build.properties"
        - to the directory you checked out to.
    - Run "ant releaseSeam" in the build directory
    - Review and Commit the release changes to repository.jboss.org
        - simple script to add new files to SVN
        - svn status | grep "^\?" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn add
            - note if you've added this to eclipse you may need to revert ".project"
        - they still need to be reviewed and commited.

* Create draft of the documentation and download pages on seamframework.org
    - documentation points to "docs.jboss.com"
    - downloads point to sourceforge download page

Final Coordination and Announcement
-----------------------------------
* For a GA release and if its newest version of Seam
    - Update "http://docs.jboss.com/seam/latest" with the docs from this version.
        - Not for cr,alpha,beta releases
    - This can take a long time
* Update the DTDs and XSDs on jboss.com/products/seam
    - Easiest way to use a script that checks for changes
        - <TODO add script to svn>
    - Update any changes to the site
* Login to sourceforge.org and modify the Seam release entry
    - Change the date to today
    - Change "Status" to active
    - Provide the link to the SF download page for the release for announcements.
* Update the documentation and download pages on seamframework.org with drafts.
* Update Jira so that version shows as "released" 
* Announce the release
    - Blog on in.relation.to
    - seamframework.org news, and forums
    - jboss.org news
    - TheServerSide.com

Update Demos
------------
* This step is not needed for every point release:
* Upload the booking and dvdstore examples to demo.jboss.com
* <TODO more information on what is needed>
* <QUESTION: is this really a part of the process or is it out of date/>

Notes
-----
* To reapply a tag:
 - First delete the original
    - svn delete https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_x_x_x_XXX 
      -m "removing old tag prior to applying updated tag"
    - ex. svn delete https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_2_1_0_B1 
          -m "removing old tag prior to applying updated tag"
 - Recopy back to tag
    -"svn copy https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/XX/XX 
      https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_x_x_x_XXX 
      -m "create JBoss_Seam_x_x_x_XXX tag""
    - ex. svn copy https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/trunk 
          https://svn.jboss.org/repos/seam/tags/JBoss_Seam_2_1_0_B1 
          -m "Updated tag for 2.1.0.B1"

[FUTURE]
--------
* Store release related scripts (especially when more automated) in svn.
* Store release logs, and reports in svn.
* Find a jar/archive reporting tool for detailed dependency, version reports.
